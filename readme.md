Weekend 2 Kappa Carousel.

built a few carousels using json files, bootstrap, angular and ng-view to switch between the carousels.

can be found on heroku @ https://glacial-castle-15553.herokuapp.com/

stretch goals,

1. need to move global variables and http calls into app.factories instead.

2. need to move all json information into a database and adjust all server routes accordingly

3. actually work on styling.

4. maybe just sublet out styling instead.

5. add some flavor text to charlie images.

6. work on making the carousel indicators dynamic. currently bootstrap explodes all over my view when i try.
